# Ansys-Code
Material heat transfer

## Intro
  In this study, the main goal is detecting some metal parts which are from the 3D printing by thermography method and find some problems or defects in the metal parts by comparing their thermal images.
  The steps for detecting an object using a thermal sensor are as follows:
1. selects a suitable device to heat the object
2. records the heat transfer of the object
3. analyzes the obtained infrared image and determines the condition of the object

## Purpose
  In this project, the method of detecting the surface structure of an object using an infrared thermal imaging sensor will be verified by simulation using the Ansys software. Find the detecting precision by comparing the infrared image errors of the square object and the
cylindrical object. The main experimental method is to use the Ansys software to simulate the heat transfer of the target object and obtain thermal images of the object. The detection accuracy of the thermography detection can be obtained by comparing the thermographic
image with the actual optical picture of the object.

## Project Steps
1. Using Ansys to simulate the heat transfer model and get the data file which is saved in Excel
2. Using Matlab to calculate the Excel data and plot the Heat transfer images
